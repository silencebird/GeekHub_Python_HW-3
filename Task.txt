Write a function to generate list of 100000 integer numbers and list of 100000 float numbers, numbers should be in range 0 - 99, this lists will be input parameters for next functions.
Write a function to sort lists of elements using the selection sort algorithm.
Write a function to sort lists of elements using the insertion sort algorithm.
Write a function to sort lists of elements using the bubble sort algorithm.
Use function sort() to sort lists.
Check calculation time of each sorting function, time format: seconds four decimal places. 
Compare sorted lists with sort() function result, results should be equal. 
Upload code to GITHUB.
Report in a private message that task is done.
Expected result:
	 selection sort:  time = N, the list is sorted correctly = true
	 insertion sort:  time = N, the list is sorted correctly = true
  	 bubble sort:  time = N, the list is sorted correctly= true
